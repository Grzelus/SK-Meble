# SK-Meble

[Check the UI/UX](assets/SK%20Meble.pdf)

This is a website project I developed for the Polish company SK Meble.
Unfortunately, it was never published online due to personal circumstances on the clientâ€™s side.

The website was built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of any frameworks or external libraries.
